This repo contains a notebook outlining an implementation of the methodology dev'd by Jonny Williams to adjust 365 day and 360 day calendar climate datasets to standard gregorian data. 

It improves on the original notebook by standardizing the routine, leveraging numpy's array functions for fast vectorized operations, and using far fewer dependencies.
